Welcome!

This repository contains some random little projects that I've made, nothing ground breaking, just having a bit of fun!

If you want to open any of the python files (they end in .py) you'll need to download python onto your terminal.
Simply type "install python3" and then "python3 --version" to confirm download. (make sure to get rid of the quotation marks)
Then to open the file type into the terminal "python filename.py" and that should open it!
